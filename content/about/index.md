# Welcome to Austin Open Mic

This is a resource for sharing all of the open mics that happen throughout the city. It is meant to be a living document, and is maintained in the code I have housed on Github.

If you see a mistake or needed change submit a Pull Request and I'd be happy to merge your code change in. If that fun and you want to do that but don't know how, reach out to me. If that sounds like work and you'd rather just have me update the change, reach out as well. :)
